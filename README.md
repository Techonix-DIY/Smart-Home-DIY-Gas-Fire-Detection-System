# Smart Home Gas & Fire Detection System (ESP8266)🔥
A DIY Smart Home Safety System based on NodeMCU ESP8266 that detects gas leaks and fire and automatically takes action to reduce risks and protect lives and property.

When a dangerous condition is detected, the system reacts automatically and in real time by activating safety devices and notifying the owner.

🚀 Features

🔥 Fire detection

🧪 Gas leak detection

💧 Automatic water pump activation

🌬️ Automatic ventilation fan control

📲 Sends alert messages to the owner

⚡ Real-time response

🌐 IoT-based smart home solution

🛠️ Fully customizable and open-source

🧠 How It Works

Sensors continuously monitor the environment for gas and fire.

When a critical level is detected:

The water pump is turned ON.

The ventilation fan starts automatically.

A warning message is sent to the owner.

The system keeps running until the environment returns to a safe state.
